# Downloadable

## SUMMARY
A Spree extension: allows for downloadable products that are served from your own server. 
Options include zipping multiple files for downloads, download limits, and emails links. 
Using the paperclip plugin, this should be already installed from Spree installation. 
Support for current Spree gem: Spree 0.9.2.

## WARNING
Does not smoothly updates from older versions of this extension.

## QUICK START
1. script/extension install git://github.com/rocket-rentals/downloadable.git
2. rake gems:install
3. rake db:migrate (or rake db:bootstrap)

## CHANGELOG
  - Added variant support - Modeled after the Spree's image paperclip attachment.
  - Auto zips files when variant/product has more than one file.
  - Code refactoring - minimized overriding of Spree model/controller/view for easier integration when upgrading to future releases.

## NOTES
	- Requires 'rubyzip' gem (sudo gem install rubyzip)
	- Enable X-Sendfile to be of praticial use, see comments in downloadable_controller.
	- Ignores shipping/shipment attributes when there are ONLY downloadable products.
	- Disables guest checking when order has a downloadable content.

## TODO
	- Integrate spree-s3-download, probably create a fork
	- Integrate or fork to another extension for mulitiple email templates.
